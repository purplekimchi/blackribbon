Arduino Sketch for Black Ribbon for Mourning

The vibration motor pulses in 1 second intervals; each pulse 
represents one black person killed by the police in 2016. The data 
comes from Mapping Police Violence.org. 

Out of deference to the creators of the dataset, we make no distinction
between the killing of those who are "unarmed" and whose who are 
"allegedly armed."
